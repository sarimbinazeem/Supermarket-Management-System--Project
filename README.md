## 📌 Overview
The **Supermarket Management System** is a console-based C project designed to manage inventory, customers, billing, authentication, and sales using text-file storage.  
It follows a **modular architecture** using separate header and source files, making the project scalable, clean, and easier to maintain.

This project replicates the essential backend operations of a real supermarket.
