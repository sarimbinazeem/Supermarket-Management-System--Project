# 🧩 Khizar — Phase-Wise Tasks

## 🔹 **Phase 1 — Project Setup**
- Created the main project folder  
- Set up the directory structure (`src/`, `include/`, `data/`)  
- Added empty data files (`products.txt`, `customers.txt`)  
- Initialised GitHub repository  
- Connected repo to VS Code  
- Created main branches:  
  - `main` (stable build)  
  - `dev` (development)  
  - Feature branches (`feature/auth`, `feature/product`, etc.)

---

## 🔹 **Phase 2 — Header File Structure**
Prepared all `.h` files with:
- Struct definitions  
- Function prototypes  
- Include guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`)

Files included:  
- `admin.h`  
- `customer.h`  
- `cahier.h`  
- `checkout.h`

---

## 🔹 **Phase 3 — Authentication System**
- Developed the complete login mechanism  
- Validated username/password through file handling  
- Built error-handling for incorrect login  
- Connected login to the main dashboard  

---

## 🔹 **Phase 4 — Product Management**
Implemented full product functionality:
- Add product  
- Search product  
- Update product  
- Delete product  
- Display product list  
- Managed inventory using `inventory.txt`  

---

## 🔹 **Phase 5 — Customer Management**
- Added functionality to register customers  
- Display customer records  
- Stored data in `customers.txt`  
- Integrated customer selection into billing  

---

## 🔹 **Phase 6 — Billing Module**
- Implemented cart and purchase system  
- Auto-reduced product stock  
- Calculated totals, discounts, and tax  
- Generated detailed invoices    

---

## 🔹 **Phase 7 — Utility Functions**
- Input validation  
- Clear screen and formatting functions  
- Date/time utilities  
- General helper functions to improve code efficiency  

---

## 🔹 **Phase 8 — System Integration**
- Built the main menu in `main.c`  
- Connected all modules together  
- Ensured smooth navigation between menus  
- Fixed file path issues (`data/*.txt`)  

---

## 🔹 **Phase 9 — Testing**
- Performed module-by-module testing  
- Fixed bugs and logic errors  
- Ensured file operations were stable  
- Handled invalid input edge cases
